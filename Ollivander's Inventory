Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.


select w.id, wp.age, w.coins_needed, w.power
from wands w
join wands_property wp on w.code = wp.code
where wp.is_evil = 0
and w.coins_needed = 
(select min(coins_needed) from wands w1 join wands_property wp1 on w1.code = wp1.code
where w1.power = w.power AND WP1.age = WP.AGE)
order by w.power desc, wp.age desc;
