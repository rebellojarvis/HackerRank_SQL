# The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.

with t1 as (select hacker_id, challenge_id, max(score) as m_score 
            from submissions 
            group by hacker_id, challenge_id)
select t1.hacker_id, h.name, sum(m_score) 
from t1 
join hackers h 
on t1.hacker_id = h.hacker_id 
group by t1.hacker_id, h.name 
having sum(m_score) > 0 
order by sum(m_score) desc, hacker_id;
